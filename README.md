# Unclosed Paragraph Tag in HTML

This repository demonstrates a common yet easily missed HTML error: an unclosed paragraph tag (`<p>`).  This can lead to unexpected rendering and layout issues in the browser. The `bug.html` file showcases the error, while `bugSolution.html` presents the corrected version.  This is a useful example to help developers catch these kinds of errors early in their code.
